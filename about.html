        I'm JT, a student learning how to navigate the HTML world. 
        I'm a fast and curious learner, focused on my projects & objectives.
        My motto is 'Make is fast, make it sleek' My  web designs are original
        and are as well built with your ideas and expectations!
        All this and more, you'll get to experience when you work with me.
